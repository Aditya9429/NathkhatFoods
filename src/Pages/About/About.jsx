             <p className='font-light text-[29px]'>Childhood friends Jake Aronskind & Matt Schkolnick created Pepper after being inspired by a group chat they were in with college friends sharing what they were cooking.</p>
             <p className='font-light text-[29px]'>Our passion for cooking started by seeing familiar dishes, and sought to create an online community for home cooks to engage and learn from each other. Weâ€™ve now spent the last 3 years building a grassroots community into one of the leading online communities for home cooks.</p>
